# SwiftUI Photo Viewer Exercise

This exercise involves building a simple SwiftUI-based iOS app that displays a list of photo metadata. When a list item is tapped, it displays the corresponding photo. You've successfully completed this exercise, and here's an overview of the key accomplishments:

1. **Efficient Data Loading**: You've loaded data from a network source in a way that ensures SwiftUI updates the view tree once the data is fetched.

2. **State Management**: You've implemented two distinct states for both the list view and the photo view: one for data loading and another for when the data is available.

3. **Optimized Data Fetching**: Recognizing that the entire view tree is constructed upfront, you've initiated data loading when a view appears on the screen, ensuring a smooth user experience.
